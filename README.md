# TextAssistant
A CLI-based project purely using C++, with the fusion of NLP and DSA, comes in handy for written English because of features like word count, uniqueness percentage, reading time, speaking time and last but not least complete summary of any English text like essays and articles.
## Abstract
To tackle the challenge of doing something related to AI(NLP) using Data Structures, we decided to do automatic extractive English text summarization. Moreover, we also implemented all data structures from scratch without using any additional libraries.
The project provides two options for input, i.e. text file or direct pasting on the console. Then it will print out the original text with all information related to it, followed by the summary of it with the number of sentences. After preprocessing the data and storing insights related to it, we used the Text rank algorithm. This algorithm finds similarities between sentences and assigns them rank. Afterwards, the algorithm will return the top-ranked of them as the summary.
